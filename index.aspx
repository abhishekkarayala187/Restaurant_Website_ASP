        <h2>Great food, innovative Lassi servings, beautiful setting</h2>
        <p>This is one 24 Hour restaurant with an imposing sight that cannot be missed even if you want to. The Restaurant can be seen a mile away from the Chandigarh, Amritsar Highway. This is truly a pure North Indian Punjabi vegetarian Dhabha. Everything is served fresh and hot and the food is top notch quality both in terms of portions and taste. The Lassi was served in a earthen pot and was very very tasty- maybe because of the container it was served in. The setting even before entering the restaurant is nice and inviting.</p>

        <h2>Absolutely fantastic!</h2>
        <p>Haweli was an absolutely fantastic experience. Seeing how they did things in Punjab in the olden days was beautiful especially how they have done it. They even had a spot for Hopscotch, where I saw my 74 year old Dad have a go! There was Alice performance once we had finished eating that was quite entertaining.
    The restaurant itself was lovely as was the food. True authentic food....the staff make sure you are stuffed by the time you leave, with their insistence on eating more! It is a great place to have a good laugh and good food. Brilliant for families & couples. </p>
